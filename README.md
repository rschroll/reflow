Reflow
======
Reflow is a Light Table plugin that allows you to reflow paragraphs to a
fixed width.  It is available in the Light Table plugin repository, or
you can clone this repository into your plugins folder.

Usage
-----
Reflow provides a new command called *Reflow paragraph*.  Without a
selection, it acts on the current paragraph, as defined below.  With a
selection, it acts on all the lines that are part of the selection
(including unselected text on those lines).  The width of the reflowed
paragraph is set in your `user.behaviors` file:
```clojure
{:+ {:editor [(:lt.plugins.reflow/set-width 72)]}}
```
You can add a key binding for the reflow command by adding to your
`user.keymap` file:
```clojure
{:+ {:editor {"ctrl-j" [:lt.plugins.reflow/reflow]}}}
```

If all the lines begin with an identical prefix of symbols and
whitespace, that prefix is stripped from all lines prior to reflowing
and is prepended to all lines after the reflowing.  This means that
reflow works with most styles of comments.  Whitespace is maintained,
except at the ends of lines.  All whitespace at the end of a line is
compressed to a single space before the reflow, and no whitespace is
left at the ends of lines after the reflow.

### Automatic paragraph selection

Reflow considers paragraphs to be sequential lines, all of which contain
an alphanumeric character (A-Z, a-z, 0-9, or any non-ASCII unicode
character).  This means that most block comment sequences will delimit
paragraphs if they occur on their own line.  Additionally, if the
current line begins with a line comment sequence, only lines that begin
with that sequence will be included in the paragraph.  (Note that this
restriction does not work the other way; a paragraph selected from an
uncommented line may include commented lines.)
